**Fall 2016 Update**: The original FuzzyCLIPS author took over the GitHub repository! It lives at [rorchard/FuzzyCLIPS on GitHub](https://github.com/rorchard/FuzzyCLIPS).

**Update**: Windows version is now 6.10d thanks to Minas Abrahamyan! Looks like there is a VC++ 6.0 folder in this version.

Today I needed to use FuzzyCLIPS under Linux as part of my studies. Unfortunately, it is no longer maintained since a bit less than ten years, and the official website is down. I was lucky enough to find the last mirror (now down) that kept a copy of FuzzyCLIPS, so I decided to mirror it too, hoping that it won't get lost in the void.

In the Linux version are also included two 32-bit executables, fz_clips, and fz_xclips, the terminal and X versions of the software. Here are the files, for you to download:
